Wager - A bankroll with an associated Hand. Since you cannot play for free,
every hand has a bet attached. This is loosely analogous to the little betting
square on the Blackjack felt, but Splitting hands breaks the analogy.

Hand - A collection of cards in a Blackjack hand. Can be empty, or could
contain a whole Deck. The Value() of a hand is determined using the rules of
Blackjack.

Deck - A collection of Cards starting with exactly the set of Pips X
  Suit. This starting set has 52 cards. It can be shuffled, and cards can be
  dealt one-by-one from the top of the deck.

Card - The fundamental unit of a card deck. Each has a Value as well as a Pip
  and Suit. Suits are irrelevant for Blackjack, but are necessary for the UI.

Bankroll - Money, matchsticks, or whatever unit of currency is used to
bet. Once a Bankroll is created, money is conserved. It can be transferred
between Bankrolls, but never removed from the system entirely. (Unless the
Bankroll object is freed, I guess. I'm not that paranoid.)
